## DESCRIPTION

This is a simple `Java Spring Boot` application using `Lombok Annotations` to reduce boilerplate code that finds
potential duplicates in an `Excel` file containing contacts and returns the accuracy of the duplicate.
<p>The algorithm complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) since the duplicates are not necessarily exact.

### INPUT:

Excel File

### OUTPUT:

JSON containing accuracy of the duplicates.
